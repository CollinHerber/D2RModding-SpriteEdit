# D2RModding-SpriteEdit
A very basic tool for editing the sprite files in Diablo II: Resurrected.

This tool has been tested and works with inventory sprite files from the alpha. Your mileage may vary with other images.

## Usage

Use the Open option to open a .sprite file. Use the save option to save a new one.

Use the Import option to import a BMP, JPG, GIF or PNG. Use the Export option to export the selected image as BMP, JPG, GIF or PNG.

It's that simple, folks.

## Known Issues

There seems to be an issue when loading buysell.sprite, in the cursors folder. It might be corrupt (?).
